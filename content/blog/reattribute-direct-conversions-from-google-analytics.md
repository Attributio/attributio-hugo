## The Problem
On average Google Analytics reports roughly 30 - 40% of all visitors as "Direct" traffic. Consequently, this means that a similar amount of conversions come from unknown sources and the amount can even be as high as half of all traffic. This is unacceptable for companies that depend on analytics to provide insights into which channels are converting so they can adapt quickly to the rapid shifts in consumer attention.

We also recommend our clients to utilize additional tools like <a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=462846&u=1517931&m=46217&urllink=&afftrack=">Improvely</a>. They have a great feature that profiles your customers so you can have a granular look at how they arrived, how much they spent, and what their behavior was on your site.
