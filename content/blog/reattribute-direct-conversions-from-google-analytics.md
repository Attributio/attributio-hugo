## The Problem
On average Google Analytics reports roughly 30 - 40% of all visitors as "Direct" traffic. Consequently, this means that a similar amount of conversions come from unknown sources and the amount can even be as high as half of all traffic. This is unacceptable for companies that depend on analytics to provide insights into which channels are converting so they can adapt quickly to the rapid shifts in consumer attention.
