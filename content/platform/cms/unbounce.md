The software was launched in 2010 along with the Unbounce blog, which was written by co-founder Oli Gardner."
benefit = "With Unbounce, you can create and optimize dedicated landing pages that prompt your visitors with one focused goal instead of leaving them to wander a site full of distractions.

why = "If you want to quickly build and publish landing pages, Unbounce will help you do that. With Unbounce, you can easily create variants for testing and have excellent templates and third-party sources like ThemeForest for more templates. Unbounceâ€™s landing page builder makes it incredibly easy to put your own designs on its templates with a lot more freedom than you may be used to with other platforms.  It has also a dynamic text replacement feature to make your personalization fast and easy to implement."
