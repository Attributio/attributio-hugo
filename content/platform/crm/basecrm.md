Like Zendesk, Base was designed to make your job easier. Now called Zendesk Sell, it allows you to manage sales, track leads and engage proactively with customers from anywhere. The system features a standalone sales automation module with options for integrated channel management and web self-service capabilities. It has native applications for iOs, Android and Windows phones."
