what = "Freshsales is the fourth addition in the Freshdesk product lineup, and a quality CRM designed for you to keep track of your contacts while solving your inquiries. It is a single contact management hub that helps you stay in control of thousands of leads, but provides you at the same time a simple and easy-to-navigate interface. Freshsale's APIs are REST based and allows you to perform ReSTful operations such as reading, modifying, adding or deleting data from your helpdesk."
benefit = "You don’t need to snap between tabs to follow up on prospects with  Freshsales because of its built-in phone and email, tasks, appointments and notes. Using the Freshsales iOS and Android apps you can keep your sales going from your smartphone, get 360° context, move leads across stages, and fix meetings. You can also manage your deals better with the pipeline view and drive more deals to closure. Also, with custom reports, tracking sales performance is a piece of cake."
why = "You can get into your hands an advanced suite of features, including auto-dialers, call recording, call routing and affiliate management, but the thing that certainly distinguishes Freshsales from similar programs is reporting. Unlike most small-biz report tools, Freshsales applies a variety of filters when summarizing your data, and makes it possible to group and organize results in your own way. Based on your own preferences, you can make summaries, create charts and tables, or master the craft of matrix reporting very fast."
