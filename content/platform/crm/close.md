Through Close.io's API, you can query just about anything."
why = "A lightweight, user-friendly, and sleek looking sales platform, Close.io is strongly focused on activity, with VoiP calling and email being deeply integrated into the platform itself. The comprehensive platform not only tracks interactions, like traditional CRM, but it also allows you to make and receive calls directly within the software solution. Close.io offers two-way email integration in all pricing tiers, meaning emails are automatically logged as well, and the top three pricing tiers give you the ability to send bulk emails. It offers a number of pre-built integrations with various sales and customer service tools."
