what = "Salesforce is one integrated CRM platform that gives all your departments – including marketing, sales, commerce, and service – a single, shared view of every customer. It is a customer relationship management solution that brings you and your customers together. Started as a Software as a Service (SaaS) company, Salesforce has grown into the fifth-largest software company in the world. Salesforce is Cloud Computing so it has replaced already the lengthy installation process and has moved everything to the internet and you can use it from anywhere with access to the internet. Salesforce provides you with the fastest path from Idea to App."
benefit = "With Salesforce, you can improve your marketing, sales, commerce, service, IT, and more, thus attracting more buyers using your personalized marketing. Salesforce provides you with powerful connected products to win more customers by getting to know their needs and concerns, delivering amazing shopping experiences, responding faster to customer support on any channel, and automating time-consuming tasks by building custom apps. "
why = "You can concentrate on building your app using Salesforce tools, rather than building the infrastructure and tools yourself. This can save you years of time and millions of dollars.  Salesforce is completely scalable to your growth since it can easily integrate with 3rd party apps. If you want to integrate it with Gmail you can do it, if you want to integrate it with your accounting software you can do that too. On the other hand, integration is tough with other CRMs."
